## Project Background and Overview
Inventory management 
The inventory dataset contains data on different warehouse locations, cost and pricing, suppliers and their restocking performance and inventory levels for the year.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Stock analysis: By evaluating the products categories, we find which one still has enough inventory left before they need to be restocked.
- Supplier Performance: An analysis of the various suppliers based on their turnover rate and average lead time for restocking products.
- Cost and Pricing Analysis: Assessment of the top five most expensive products based on unit price and turnover based on the stock quantity and lead time.
