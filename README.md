# SQL-Data-Analysis
# Inventory Management Dataset
## Project Background and Overview
An effective inventory management is critical to operational efficiency, cost control, and customer satisfaction in any product-based business. This exploratory analysis presents a comprehensive insight into an inventory management system of our hypothetical company. 

The inventory dataset contains data on different warehouse locations, cost and pricing, suppliers and their restocking performance and inventory levels for the year.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Stock analysis: By evaluating the products categories, we find which one still has enough inventory left before they need to be restocked.
- Supplier Performance: An analysis of the various suppliers based on their turnover rate and average lead time for restocking products.
- Cost and Pricing Analysis: Assessment of the top five most expensive products based on unit price and turnover based on the stock quantity and lead time.

## Data Structure
 The inventory management consists of just one table which was then modelled by me to provide better insights as shown below:
